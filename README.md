## Core Philosophy

"Are You Actually Winning?" serves as a "blunt object" - providing pieces of a mirror for users to create their own reality check against sportsbook inconsistencies. The platform doesn't promise edges or advantages, but rather reveals what's actually happening with your money through honest data tracking.

## Privacy & Data

- **100% Client-Side**: No server, no database, no tracking
- **Local Storage Only**: Your data never leaves your browser
- **Anonymous Research**: Optional participation in betting behavior research
- **Export Freedom**: Full data portability through CSV/JSON export

## Contributing

This project focuses on honest self-assessment tools for bettors. Contributions should align with the core mission of providing transparent, unbiased tracking without promising gambling advantages.

## Case Study

Users can optionally contribute anonymous data to research on sports betting impacts across the community. All participation is voluntary and can be revoked at any time.
