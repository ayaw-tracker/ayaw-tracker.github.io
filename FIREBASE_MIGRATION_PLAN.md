# ðŸ”¥ AYAW Firebase Migration Plan

## Overview
Migrating AYAW from Express/PostgreSQL to Firebase stack while maintaining the privacy-first, audit-ready philosophy.

## Phase 1: Firebase Foundation (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Firebase Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize Firebase project with Authentication, Firestore, Functions, Hosting
- [ ] Configure Firebase emulator suite for local development
- [ ] Set up security rules for Firestore
- [ ] Configure Firebase config for client app

### 1.2 Frontend Infrastructure Changes
```bash
# New dependencies to add
npm install firebase
npm install -D firebase-tools

# Remove old backend dependencies
npm uninstall express drizzle-orm drizzle-kit @neondatabase/serverless
```

### 1.3 Client-Side Firebase Integration
- [ ] Create `lib/firebase.ts` - Firebase configuration
- [ ] Create `lib/auth.ts` - Authentication hooks and context
- [ ] Create `lib/firestore.ts` - Firestore data layer
- [ ] Update `lib/queryClient.ts` for Firebase integration
- [ ] Add offline support with Firestore caching

### 1.4 Authentication System
- [ ] Replace custom auth with Firebase Auth
- [ ] Add email/password authentication
- [ ] Optional: Add Google/Apple sign-in
- [ ] Create protected route wrapper
- [ ] Add auth state management

## Phase 2: Data Layer Migration (Week 2-3)

### 2.1 Firestore Schema Design
```typescript
// Collections structure:
/users/{userId}
  - profile data
  
/users/{userId}/bets/{betId}
  - bet documents (subcollection for privacy)
  - maintains user data isolation
  
/users/{userId}/analytics/{year}
  - pre-computed analytics by year
  - improves query performance
```

### 2.2 Frontend Data Hooks
- [ ] Create `hooks/useBets.ts` - Firestore bet operations
- [ ] Create `hooks/useAnalytics.ts` - Real-time analytics
- [ ] Create `hooks/useAuth.ts` - Authentication state
- [ ] Update existing components to use new hooks

### 2.3 Real-time Updates
- [ ] Implement Firestore real-time listeners
- [ ] Add optimistic updates for better UX
- [ ] Maintain React Query for caching strategy

## Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Week 3-4)

### 3.1 Offline-First Capabilities
- [ ] Enable Firestore offline persistence
- [ ] Add offline status indicator
- [ ] Queue operations when offline
- [ ] Sync conflict resolution

### 3.2 Advanced Firebase Features
- [ ] Cloud Functions for complex analytics
- [ ] Scheduled functions for periodic reports
- [ ] Cloud Storage for CSV/JSON exports
- [ ] Firebase Extensions (if needed)

### 3.3 Privacy & Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement row-level security with Firestore rules
- [ ] Add data encryption for sensitive fields
- [ ] Audit log for all data operations
- [ ] GDPR compliance features (data export/deletion)

## Phase 4: Performance & Scaling (Week 4-5)

### 4.1 Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement pagination for bet history
- [ ] Add data aggregation in Cloud Functions
- [ ] Optimize Firestore queries with composite indexes
- [ ] Add loading states and skeleton screens

### 4.2 Advanced Analytics
- [ ] Real-time dashboard updates
- [ ] Trend analysis with historical data
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Custom report generation

### 4.3 Mobile Experience
- [ ] Progressive Web App (PWA) setup
- [ ] Push notifications (optional)
- [ ] Mobile-specific UI optimizations
- [ ] Touch gestures and interactions

## Phase 5: Production Readiness (Week 5-6)

### 5.1 Testing & Quality
- [ ] Unit tests for Firebase functions
- [ ] Integration tests with Firebase emulators
- [ ] E2E testing with Cypress/Playwright
- [ ] Performance testing

### 5.2 Deployment & CI/CD
- [ ] Firebase Hosting deployment
- [ ] GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] Environment management (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Monitoring and logging setup

### 5.3 Migration Strategy
- [ ] Data export from current system
- [ ] Batch import to Firestore
- [ ] User migration flow
- [ ] Rollback plan

## Technical Architecture Changes

### Current Stack â†’ Firebase Stack
```
Express API â†’ Cloud Functions
PostgreSQL â†’ Firestore
Drizzle ORM â†’ Firebase SDK
Custom Auth â†’ Firebase Auth
Node.js Server â†’ Serverless Functions
```

### Frontend Data Flow
```
React Components
    â†“
Custom Hooks (useBets, useAuth)
    â†“
Firebase SDK (Auth, Firestore)
    â†“
Cloud Functions (when needed)
    â†“
Firestore Database
```

### Security Model
```
Frontend Rules:
- Authentication required for all operations
- Users can only access their own data
- Real-time validation with Zod schemas

Firestore Rules:
- User-based data isolation
- Field-level security
- Audit trail for all operations
```

## Benefits of Firebase Migration

### For Users
- âœ… **Faster Performance** - Real-time updates, better caching
- âœ… **Offline Support** - Works without internet connection
- âœ… **Better Security** - Enterprise-grade authentication
- âœ… **Mobile Experience** - PWA capabilities, push notifications

### For Development
- âœ… **Simplified Backend** - No server management
- âœ… **Scalability** - Automatic scaling with usage
- âœ… **Real-time Features** - Live data updates
- âœ… **Local Development** - Full emulator suite

### For Privacy (Core Mission)
- âœ… **Data Isolation** - User data completely separated
- âœ… **Audit Ready** - Built-in logging and compliance
- âœ… **Local-First** - Offline persistence maintains privacy
- âœ… **No Social Features** - Maintains private, defensive approach
